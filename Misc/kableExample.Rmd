```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is just a quick illustration of using kable.
Both kable() and kableExtra have lots of other arguments/functions for further refinement
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
sillyTibble <- tibble(a = runif(20), b=rnorm(20))
sillyTibble %>% kable(digits = 5)
```
